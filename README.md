# **Scanni**

The Scanni app is to be used by students from LUCA School of Arts and the persons 
responsible for the workplaces in the school.

In the workplaces students can use different machines while working on their projects. 
Typical machines are sawing machines, milling machines, electrical screwdrivers, 3D printers, 
laser cutters,â€¦Certain equipment can be used without instruction, but other, more specialized, 
equipment may only be used when some training has been followed successfully.

app will allow to check that the student has the certificate.
